Objectives:  
      •     Know the common causes and management options of frequently seen electrolyte  
            changes   
  

                                                                   Electrolytes  
      
Glucose:    
       
Hypoglycaemia   
  
Insulin overdose:   
      •     If due to insulin overdose must continue glucose supplementation with 2.5% glucose solution  
            (or higher), until insulin wears off (ie. blood glucose starts to increase)    
      •     Note severe  insulin overdose require higher rates of glucose supplementation and occasional  
            boluses of dextrose   
      •     Must  monitor  electrolytes  especially  potassium  as  this  will  shift  intracellularly  resulting  in  
            hypokalaemia, this can occasionally require aggressive potassium supplementation greater than  
            the recommended 0.5mEq/kg/hr   
      •     Hypophosphatemia can occur as it is shifted intracellularly by insulin   
      •     Glucagon CRI:   
            •     If persistent and severe hypoglycaemia eg. Severe insulin overdose or insulinoma, consider  
                  starting glucagon CRI – administer a 50ng/kg bolus followed by a CRI of 5-40ng/kg/min   
              •   Glucagon promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis   
  
Insulinoma:   
      •     Insulin secreting tumour in the pancreas   
      •     Dextrose bolus and CRI   
      •     Some sources suggest aggressive monitoring of blood glucose with glucose CRI for patients  
            with  suspected  insulinomas,  as  excessive  hyperglycaemia  can  stimulate  insulin  release,  
            resulting in a huge and excessive release of insulin from the tumour leading to hypoglycaemia   
                                                                               
Treatment:  
      •     Give dextrose 0.5 –  1ml/kg of 50% IV diluted with saline 1:3 (to reduce vasculitis) given over  
            5 minutes   
      •     Offer food if able to ie. Patient is bright and there is no contraindications   
      •     Dextrose CRI at 2.5 to 5% if require longer term glucose supplementation   
              •   2.5% = 50ml of 50% dextrose in 950ml   
              •   5% = 100ml of 50% dextrose in 900ml

    INCREASED:                                                       DECREASED:   
                                                                       
    Hypernatraemia can be thought of a deficit of Hyponatraemia can be thought of as free  
    free water. This can occur from:                                 water excess. This can occur from:   
         -     Loss of ‘water’                                            -    Ingestion of water    
         -     Lack of ADH                                                -    ADH release   
         -     Gain of salt                                            
                                                                     Again, this has nothing to do with volume  
    Remember that sodium concentration has                           status.    
    nothing to do with volume status. A

Hypernatraemia:   

------------------4---------------

  -    Acute hypernatraemia  can cause cellular dehydration resulting in brain shrinkage and tearing  
       of cerebral blood vessels (SCHAER). Chronic gradual hypernatraemia results in formation of  
       idiogenic osmoles (form over 24-48 hour period), they increase intracellular osmolality and  
       draw water back into cells    
  -    Hypernatraemia is rare in an alert, conscious animal with a normal thirst mechanism and access  
       to water.  
  -    Onset  of  clinical  signs  of  hypernatremia  are  concerning  when  sodium  level  >170mEq/L,  
       chronic  onset  hypernatraemia  >160mEq/L  can  result  in  the  formation  of  idiogenic  osmoles  
       (Willard)   
  -    Rapid  rehydration  of  a  hypernatraemic  patient  results  in  rapid  reduction  in  serum  sodium,  
       leading to water being drawn into the cells causing cellular swelling ie. Cerebral oedema.   
  
  In moderate to severe hypernatraemia aim to REDUCE sodium by less than 0.5mEq/L per  
  hour:   
         •       Monitoring electrolytes every 4 hours   
         •       If neurological signs occur treat with mannitol 0.5-1g/kg IV over 20 minutes OR 7%  
         saline at 3-5ml/kg over 20 minutes   
            
    Types of hypernatraemia:   
       -    Hypervolaemic hypernatraemia    
                      •     Hypernatremia results from increased Na intake or reabsorption   
                      •     Most likely sodium gain from IV fluids or food, also from acute renal failure,  
                           hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome)   
                      •     Distended jugular veins, high CVP, pulmonary oedema    
            •    Treatment  
                      •     Rate of correction depends of rate of increase.  If it was a rapid increase due  
                           to salt ingestion or hypertonic saline administration, can correct rapidly.  If  
                            chronic then correct slowly by 0.5mEq/hr   
                      •     Correct free water deficit with 5% dextrose as per normovolaemic  
                           hypernatraemia   
                      •    A loop diuretic such as furosemide can be trialled 2mg/kg IV to reduce Na+  
                           reabsorption   
                      •     If neurological signs occur treat with mannitol 0.5-1g/kg IV over 20 minutes  
                            OR hypertonic 7% saline at 3-5ml/kg over 20 minutes   
  
  
       -    Normovolaemic hypernatraemia    
                      •     Hypernatremia with euvolemia is a decrease in total body water with near- 
                           normal total body Na (pure water deficit)    
                      •     Free water loss with no signs of dehydration, usually results in very high  
                           Na+   
                      •     Diabetes insipidus, hypodipsia    
            o    Treatment  
                           Oral fluid replacement is also ideal but some of these animals will be unable  
                           to drink   
                           Calculate free water deficit and replace slowly over the number of hours it  
                           takes to decrease Na+ by 0.5mEq/hr:    
                      
Free water deficit = (([Current Na+] / [Desired Na+]) –  1) x (0.6 x body weight)   
                        
Number of hours to decrease Na+ (by 0.5mEq/L/hr) = ([Current Na+] – [Desired Na+]) / 0.5   
   
          How many ml/hr of 5% dextrose = (ml of free water required / number of hours)   
                                                             Or   
               4ml/kg/hr of 5% dextrose to decreases sodium by 0.5mmol/hr (Haskins)

                                     Cover maintenance and any ongoing losses (eg. Diarrhoea or vomiting)  
                                      with another isotonic crystalloid    
                                     Monitor electrolytes every 4 hours   
                                     If neurological signs occur treat with mannitol 0.5-1g/kg IV over 20  
                                      minutes OR hypertonic 7% saline at 3-5ml/kg over 20 minutes   
                                     Avoid and monitor for over hydration – can measure central venous  
                                      pressure as a guide   
  
           -    Hypovolaemic hypernatraemia   
                                           Hypernatremia  associated  with  hypovolaemia  occurs  with  Na+  loss  
                                            accompanied by a relatively greater loss of water from the body   
                                           Hypotonic or free water renal or gastrointestinal loss   
                                           Signs  of  dehydration  and  hypovolaemia  ie.  Dry  and  or  pale  mucus  
                                            membranes,   prolonged   capillary   time,   skin   tenting,   weak   pulse  
                                            pressure and low blood pressure    
                      o    Treatment   
                                     Correct perfusion deficits with crystalloid solution supplemented with  
                                      sodium to within 5 -  10mEq/L of the serum (Creedon 2015).  See  
                                      formula below to work out how much hypertonic saline to add.   
                                     If the hypernatraemia has developed over a 24 hour period, replace free  
                                      water deficits slowly over a 2 – 3 day period, correct slower than 0.5mEq/L

                                     Subsequent improvement in renal blood flow and function should correct  
                                      the hypernatraemia by increased renal excretion   
                                     Monitor electrolytes every 4 hours   
                     
                                     Supplement IV fluid with sodium:   
             
                                            •    Add additional NaCl from hypertonic saline (eg. NaCl 7%) to  
                                                 increase Na+ content of the IV fluid   
                                            •    Use the formula below, to find out how much hypertonic saline is  
                                                 required:   
                     
 Volume (mls) to add to IV fluid bag  = ([Current IV fluid Na+]– [Desired IV fluid Na+]) x 1000   
                                                              ([Desired IV fluid Na+] – [Hypertonic saline Na+])    
      
Eg. If want to increase IV fluid Na+ to 175 from 150mEq/L, and you have a 7% saline (1155mEq/L)  
as a supplemental Na+ source:   
                     
Volume (mls) to be added =   (150 –  175) x 1000    = 25.5ml of 7% saline    
                                            (175–  1155)   
       
                                            •    If there is no improvement in hypernatraemia after trying to  
                                                 correct hypovolaemia then consider free water supplementation  
                                                 with 5% dextrose as per “Normovolaemic hypernatraemia”   
       
                     
                     
Hyponatraemia:   
           -    Rate of INCREASE should not exceed 0.5mEq/L per hour – otherwise can cause  
                cerebral dehydration as the plasma is hypertonic to the brain and cause central pontine  
                myelinolysis:   
           -    Especially important until reach >130mEq/L

-     Monitoring eloslectrolytes every 4 hours   
           
          
  
-     Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia due to hypotonic losses or hypoadrenocorticism   
            o    Reduced circulating volume from fluid losses results in release of ADH, this  
                 results in increased free water reabsorption and also increased thirst, therefore  
                 reducing plasma sodium   
            o    Hyponatraemia in hypoadrenocorticism is due to reduced aldosterone section, this  
                 results in reduced sodium reabsorption combined with increased free water  
                 ingestion/reabsorption due to ADH release.   
            o    Clinical signs are consistent with dehydration and hypovolaemia - weakness,  
                 depression, rapid and weak pulses, prolonged capillary refill times, cold  
                 extremities and hypotension   
            o    Volume resuscitation and rehydration with a fluid where the sodium  
                 concentration is within 5 to 10mEq/L of the patient’s plasma sodium level.   
            o    Can use a mix of 5% dextrose in water with 0.9% saline to get the required  
                 sodium concentration in the IV fluid, use the formula below:   
            o    Maintenance requirements can be administered with an IV fluid of a high sodium  
                 such as 0.9% saline if sodium concentration does not increase   
     
 Volume (mls) to be added = ([Current IV fluid Na+] – [Desired IV fluid Na+]) x 1000

-     Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia due to retention of free water   
            o    Clinical signs reflect underlying disease – oedema, ascites, pleural effusion   
            o    Water restriction only for inappropriate ADH secretion or primary polydipsia  
                 (BOTH RARE)   
            o    Free water ingestion Playing with the hose   
            o    Congestive heart failure – normal body sodium levels but excess free water   
                            Reduced cardiac output is interpreted as reduced circulating  
                             volume.  Renin-angiotensin activation leads to release of ADH and  
                             aldosterone, resulting in sodium and free water reabsorption and  
                             increased thirst.   Ultimately leading to an excess of free water.   
            o    Advanced liver (cirrhosis) or renal failure (nephrotic syndrome)   
                            Both can result in hypoalbuminaemia leading to shift of fluid in the  
                             interstitial space and third spacing, the resultant reduction in effective  
                             circulating volume leads to activation of ADH leading to free water  
                             accumulation in an attempt to restore circulating volume.

Hyperkalaemia   
       -    Effects on excitable membranes:   
         •        Causes depolarisation of the resting membrane potential   
         •        The resting cell membrane becomes less negative initially, this increases excitability  
         so that a smaller stimulus is required to stimulate the cell. BUT if the RMP decrease  
         becomes equal to or less than threshold potential depolarisation results and repolarisation  
         cannot occur    
         •        Reduced difference between RMP and TP   
         •        Cardiac abnormalities maybe seen with K+ > 6.0mEq/L   
                       •    ECG abnormalities include   
                                 •     High peaked or deep T waves   
                                 •     Prolonged PR intervals

                    o    Traditionally potassium free fluid but any balanced isotonic fluid can be used   
                    o    By increasing intravascular volume will dilute serum potassium, alkalinsation  
                         will result in an exchange for K+ (into the cell) with H+ (coming out of the cell).

                         •    Calcium supplementation restores potential difference between resting and  
                             threshold potentials by making the threshold potential less negative –  
                             membrane excitability is restored  
                         •   Acts within minute to protects against cardiotoxic effects by altering the  
                             threshold potential. This enables the previously hypo-polarized cells to  
                              depolarize again.   
                         •   Must instigate other treatments as only protects for 20 minutes and does not  
                              alter serum K+   
                    o    Insulin and dextrose OR dextrose alone:

                                  •    2g of dextrose per unit of insulin = 4ml of 50% dextrose OR 40ml of  
                                       5% dextrose for each unit of insulin FOLLOWED with CRI of 2.5%  
                                       glucose at maintenance rates for 6 -8 hours   
                         •    Insulin drives K+ back into cells but must be followed with dextrose CRI to  
                             prevent hypoglycaemia from the insulin therapy    
                         •   Dextrose by itself will stimulate endogenous insulin production    
                         •   Monitor blood glucose and potassium levels   
                    o    Bicarbonate therapy

                                       safe. Adverse effects of bicarbonate therapy are related to speed of  
                                       administration so be cautious.   
                         •   Acts within 15mins by inducing a metabolic alkalosis   
                         •   Metabolic alkalosis results in H+ ions being drawn out of the cell in exchange  
                              for potassium   
                         •   Bicarbonate may negate the cardioprotective effects of intravenous calcium  
                             by altering the pH resulting in increased binding of calcium to albumin

                                  Add into IV calcium free fluids   
                    o    Alternatively, determine the amount of potassium supplementation needed, give  
                         half the amount as KCI and the other half as KPO4 (potassium phosphate)   
                    o    Treatment:   
                                  Administer in calcium free fluids and avoid if patient is hypercalcaemic   
                                  Discontinue when serum phosphorus = 0.9 mmol/L   
                    o    Monitor phosphate levels every 6 hours
